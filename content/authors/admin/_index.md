Welcome to my website! I am a postdoctoral fellow at the UBC Sauder School of Business. My areas of research include international trade, energy and environmental economics, and applied econometrics.

I am also a sessional instructor at the Thompson Rivers University and University Canada West, where I teach courses in economics and business.
