abstract: Energy storage has long been viewed as a solution to the growing challenge of intermittent electricity supply. However, energy storage deployment remains limited despite falling costs. One reason for this is current market rules inadequately compensate storage for all the value it can provide. A recent policy change in the United States seeks to rectify this situation by requiring grid operators to compensate providers of frequency regulation services based on speed and accuracy. This seemingly subtle change has a beneficial effect for fast-acting storage resources. Using a difference-in-differences method, exploiting the fact the Order covers a subset of U.S. electricity regions, we find a greater than 30% increase in the number of storage projects in the covered regions. This result highlights the importance of getting prices right and the material effect properly reflecting the value of storage can have on storage deployment.

summary: We look at the role market rules, and changes in those rules, have on deployment of energy storage in electricity systems. #The paper provides a key contribution in this area of growing importance, as it is the first to provide well-identified empirical estimates of the responsiveness of storage investment to changes in market rules. While technological barriers are often described as the reason for limited deployment of storage to-date, our results suggest that policy reforms to properly compensate storage resources for the services they perform can have a material effect on deployment.
